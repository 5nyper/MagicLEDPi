#TODO

- [x] set-up LED light on breadboard
- [x] implement `<wiringPi.h>` with GPIO pins controlling the LED
- [x] set-up web server to call the programs that control the LED
- [x] update single light LED to RGB LED and implement `<softPwm.h>` to control different channels and brightness
- [ ] create iOS app to talk to the webserver (95% done)
- [ ] create Android app(?)
- [ ] expand on the project to make it more than a Proof of Concept, (I.E change color according to input sound?)
