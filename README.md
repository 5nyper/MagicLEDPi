#TODO

- [x] ~~set-up LED light on breadboard~~
- [x] ~~implement `<wiringPi.h>` with GPIO pins controlling the LED~~
- [x] ~~update single light LED to RGB LED and implement `<softPwm.h>` to control different channels and brightness~~
- [ ] use https://github.com/Vikaton/ws281x-rs because I'm redesiging this whole project :)
- [x] set-up web server to call the programs that control the LED
- [x] create iOS app to talk to the webserver (Screenshots coming soon)
- [ ] create Android app(?)
- [ ] expand on the project to make it more than a Proof of Concept, (I.E change color according to input sound?)
